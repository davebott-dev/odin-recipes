    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p><em>Eggnog</em> is a thick, creamy, and dairy- and egg-based drink. It's 
    traditionally made in large batches and served at holiday gatherings. 
    It's often spiked with bourbon or rum, but it is also frequently served 
    without alcohol. </p>
    <p>It's hard to explain the flavor of <strong>eggnog</strong> to someone who hasn't tasted
    it, but we'll try: Eggnog is custardy, rich, creamy, and sweet. It 
     tastes a bit like melted ice cream that's been spiced with nutmeg.  </p>
